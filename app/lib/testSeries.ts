          Hello Everyone One,
I am SAIKAT ADHIKARI, currently doing my MSc program at IIT KANPUR. I done my Bachelor's Degree in physics from SERAMPORE COLLEGE ( Calcutta University)..
I secured All india Rank 106 in JAM-2024 and All india Rank 320 in JEST-2024  & I also Qualified TIFR_GS_2024 Exam. I attempted one free Test for TIFR and a premium Test series for JEST from Mission Physics. Mission Physics is not a reputed institute as compared to other Coaching Institute in india but it's Faculty members are very good and  most of there  from Sofisticated Institute like NISER,HRI and IIT'S.. The quality of the test is very good and level of the Questions is very similar as in the exam. So it's help me a lot's to bust my experience and also my confidence.

Covering the syllabus of jam was not a big task for me but the time management was the part where i was lacking.
Here comes the big role of MISSION PHYSICS  
I sincerely thank the Mission Physics  for their well-structured test series, which greatly enhanced my time management skills and provided valuable insights into concepts I had not explored during my preparation. Their guidance and support played a significant role in helping me achieve All India Rank 76 in IIT JAM and secure admission to my dream college, IIT Bombay .

          I am Subhadip Jana, a B.Sc. graduate from Midnapore College (Autonomous).

I began preparing for competitive exams like IIT JAM and JEST through self-study before enrolling in the test series provided by Mission Physics for JAM, JEST, and CUET. The structured test series played a pivotal role in enhancing my preparation, offering valuable practice and strategic insights that significantly boosted my performance.

As a result of this rigorous preparation and guidance, I achieved:

AIR 744 in IIT JAM.

Qualified in JEST.

A score of 182 in CUET.


I am delighted to share that I secured admission to IIT Dhanbad.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Mission Physics for their invaluable support in my academic journey. The test series provided a transformative learning experience that greatly contributed to my success.

Thank you, Mission Physics!
